-- | A thread.
--
-- ==== __ðŸ‘‰ Details__
--
-- * A thread's lifetime is delimited by the scope in which it was created.
--
-- * The thread that creates a scope is considered the parent of all threads created within it.
--
-- * If an exception is raised in a child thread, the child either propagates the exception to its parent (see
--   'Ki.fork'), or returns the exception as a value (see 'Ki.forkTry').
--
-- * All threads created within a scope are terminated when the scope closes.

--
-- [@allocationLimit@]:
--
--     The maximum number of bytes a thread may allocate before it is delivered an

--     Default: @""@ (no label)
--
-- [@maskingState@]:
--
--     The masking state a thread is created in. To unmask, use 'GHC.IO.unsafeUnmask'.
